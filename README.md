# Influenza-Analysis
 &lt; Back Influenza Preparing for Influenza season in the United States
 
PROBLEM

The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Staff agency must determine where and how many staff to send to each state in order to prepare hospitals for the upcoming flu season.

#OBJECTIVE

Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state

Who are the most impacted population?

When is influenza seasonality, throughout the year ?


#KEY NOTES

In this project, I started by cleaning the data to remove unwanted values, ensuring a clean dataset for analysis and visualization. Verified the origin and reliability of US Census data. Summarized Influenza Lab Tests and Patient Visit datasets. Created pivot tables for Census data, regrouping age groups for easier analysis. Used VLOOKUP to integrate datasets and determine correlations. Tested a hypothesis on flu deaths among those aged 85+, confirming a strong correlation. Visualized data using Tableau for forecasts and analysis, published as a storyboard.
